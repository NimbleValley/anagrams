A simple and fun anagram game! Complete with single-player as well as an online multiplayer mode.

Form words with randomly assigned letters. Try to increase your score as the timer runs! You are unable to type capital letters or letters that are not given to you. You only may use each letter as many times as it was given (ie. if you are given one 's', you can't use words with more than one 's'). CLick the button or the enter key to check the word. If it counts, the input will clear and points will be awarded based on word length. If not, you can quickly clear the input by clicking control or alt.

Online mode is similar to offline but you compete in real time against players all around the world. The game does not cap player count but only three other ones will show on the screen. **To change your name, press '?' on your keyboard and enter a name in.** Each game will be synchronized to the clock so all players get the same amount of time. Additionally, letter randomization is seeded so players in your region should have the same amount of letters. Beware of the sound effects.

**_This game is best played with volume, especially turned all the way up._**
